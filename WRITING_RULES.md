# Writing Rules

**Teach, don't cite.** When referencing a paper, explain it well enough that the reader never needs to open the original to follow your argument. Write the version you wish existed when you first read it.

**Context before ideas.** Every new concept gets: what problem it responds to, what you were thinking when it appeared, then the idea itself, then what it means. Never drop something cold.

**Self-contained entries.** Any entry should be readable on its own. Tags let people go deeper. No entry requires homework.

**The prerequisite problem.** When an entry needs math or concepts the reader probably doesn't have — teach it. Not a textbook chapter, but enough that they can follow. This is part of the whole point of the series. If you can't explain the prerequisite clearly enough for someone to follow, you probably don't understand it well enough yet either.

**Personal voice.** This is you thinking, not performing. Wrong turns stay in. The humanity is the point.
