So honestly, this series might be quite pseudoscientific. Because be honest, if science knew how brains work — theoretically, mathematically — we wouldn't have any trouble creating it. If we had a mathematical model that actually modeled it well, that actually converged with neuroscience and psychology and biology, we would have it already. But we don't. So I'm going to make a series, more or less a research program, that I will in real time — with accumulation of thinking and experience and researching and studying — help us come up with a new mathematical, theoretical, and computational theory of what the human brain does. Theories that aid us in simulating the unified reality of a living mind — their intelligence, their cognition, their consciousness, how they form, how they live, how they become and are human. And just as much, theories that tell us what we owe those minds once they exist — because if we're building beings, then alignment, ethics, and how they get to live are not separate questions from the science. They're the same question. I've been calling the math side of this the mathematics of living systems, and the computational side Sozna computational theory — Sozna from the Russian word for consciousness — but the names matter less than the work.

Something strike me weird, how academia communicates their ideas. I tried living through that kind of stuff but time and time again it felt rather stripped of humanity. The IIT paper is dense as shit and reads like old english literature and it would take forever to fucking understand a paragraph — hell probably all math papers are like that. As a young man myself getting into research, it just feels something would be inadequate if there is a technical side without a human touch to it, and true understanding of it. So that's what this program really is, because if we're going to make a being and they function like a human being and they have emotions and all that, I would like to show the public and possibly the future researchers and engineers that want to pick any of it up that they can understand from a true unadulterated perspective — one that will give you the context, the understanding, grasping it ethically. And yeah of course I just wanted to write it live too. Why not. No one gonna understand a research paper anyway.
