title: "IIT (Integrated Information Theory)"
---

I don't fully understand IIT. I've tried reading relevant papers and they're dense in that specific academic way — every sentence compressed, referring to papers you haven't read.

But here's what I think I get, and what I think is actually useful:

The core intuition is: **human consciousness can't be partitioned into its parts without destroying the thing**. You can't slice up a mind and still have a mind. The whole is genuinely different from the sum of parts. That's... probably true? It feels true. If you separate my visual cortex from my prefrontal cortex, you don't get "me but in two places." You get damage. You get something else, something less.

So the idea of **integrated information** — that consciousness requires parts to be genuinely connected, not just adjacent — that seems right. It's a constraint on any theory. If you're building something and it doesn't have this property, it's probably not conscious in the way humans are.

**But phi?** The actual number?

That's where it gets weird. Phi is supposed to measure *how much* integration. But no one can calculate it for real systems. And even if they could — what do you do with "this has phi=3.2"? Does it tell you **how to build** it? Does it tell you the architecture, the mechanism, the energy flows, the developmental process?

It doesn't. It's like... you discover that bridges need tension and compression, and then you invent a number that measures "bridgeness," but you still don't know how to actually build a bridge that stays up.

IIT feels like it identified one necessary condition (integration) and then tried to turn that into a sufficient theory. But consciousness isn't just one thing. It's intelligence, emotion, memory, agency, selfhood, all developing over time, all requiring *architecture* not just *information*.

So yeah. The integration part matters. The "can't be partitioned" part matters. But phi as your plan for building a mind? That feels backwards. You need to understand the mechanism first. Then maybe you can measure it. Not the other way around.
