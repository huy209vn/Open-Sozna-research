A **manifold** is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space near each point. 

More precisely, an $n$-dimensional manifold is a space where every point has a neighborhood that can be mapped homeomorphically to an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$.

## Key Properties

- **Local flatness**: Zoom in enough, and it looks like $\mathbb{R}^n$
- **No self-intersections** (for embedded manifolds)
- Can be curved globally while remaining smooth locally

## Examples

- A sphere $S^2$ is a 2-manifold
- A circle $S^1$ is a 1-manifold
- The configuration space of a robot arm is often a manifold

In neural dynamics, the state of a population of neurons often evolves on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the high-dimensional activity space.
